# Porter

A porter is person that 

- carries things, such as bags
- performs routine cleaning, likely on a train, taking care of the sleeping berths.

AGRC manages the additions, replacements, and deletions of SGID items in the broadest sense

## How to use

1. When an application, dataset, or both needs to be deleted or moved to a different long-term storage, [create a new issue](https://github.com/agrc/cemetery/issues/new/choose)
1. Choose the `Deprecate SGID Dataset or Web Application` template from the buttons
1. Tag the three triagers (one from each team) in the triage section
1. The triagers will choose which items need to be handled and tag the appropriate people to handle them
   - Items that don't need to be handled should be struck through (wrap the line with `~`'s) instead of being deleted
1. The people assigned to different issues will check the boxes as they are completed and comment on the issue to notify the rest of the group.
1. Once all boxes are checked, close the issue.
