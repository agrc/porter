### Action items

1. _Assign a person who should complete the task by replacing `name` with their github `@name`._
1. _Check [x] the box when the task is completed and add the date of completion._
1. _~Strike~ out all items that do not apply._

- [ ] Move entry from SGID.META.AGOLItems to AGOLItems_shelved in AGOL (name, completed: `2025/00/00`)
  - [ ] For datasets that will continue to be updated and only live in AGOL, leave the `CATEGORY` field blank. Auditor will split the tablename to determine the category.
  - [ ] For datasets that are not being updated and should only live in AGOL, set `CATEGORY` to `static`. Auditor will set the category/folder/thumbnail according to the category in the tablename and add both a `static` tag and a note in the description about it continuing to be part of the SGID.
  - [ ] For datasets that have been superseded by a newer version but should still be kept for historical reference (like previous census or tax area data), set `CATEGORY` to `shelved`. Auditor will move the dataset to the UGRC Shelf folder and group and add a note in the description.
- [ ] Update the [SGID Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ASS7LnxgpnD0jN4utzklREgMf1pcvYjcXcIcESHweQ/edit#gid=1024261148) update "storageType" to be "AGOL". (name, completed: `2025/00/00`)
- [ ] Check if this layer in the base maps. If so, work with Zach to develop a path forward before you proceed with a Hard Delete (name, completed: `2025/00/00`).
- [ ] Add "Backup" tag to AGOL Item so that it is backed up by [Moonwalk](https://github.com/agrc/project-moonwalk) (name, completed: `2025/00/00`)
- [ ] Manually remove data from the Internal SGID (name, completed: `2025/00/00`)
- [ ] Remove Farm from AGOL connection (forklift) (name, completed: `2025/00/00`)
- [ ] Update relevant [gis.utah.gov](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/categories/) product pages (including `downloadMetadata.ts` and `public/_redirects`) (name , completed: `2025/00/00`)
- [ ] Delete Google Drive data (name, completed: `2025/00/00`)
- [ ] Remove row from `SGID.META.ChangeDetection` (name, completed: `2025/00/00`) (it was already gone)
